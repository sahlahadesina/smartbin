# Overview
The Smart Bin is an innovative waste management solution designed to automatically classify and sort trash into three categories: plastic, paper, and metal. By integrating an AI-powered model and an embedded system, this project aims to promote efficient recycling practices.

## Features
1. AI Classification: A camera module is used to capture images of trash items. An AI model, trained on a dataset from Kaggle, classifies the items into three categories.
2. Embedded System: A Raspberry Pi controls the system, including the camera module and servos.
3. Servo-Controlled Flaps: Flaps open and close based on the classification results. A rotating flap directs trash into the appropriate bin.
   
## Flowchart and Modular Design:
The modular system design ensures easy maintenance and scalability.
